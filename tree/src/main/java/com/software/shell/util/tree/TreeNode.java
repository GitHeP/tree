/**
 * This interface represents the basic tree data structure
 * <h1>Definition</h1>
 * A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally) as a collection of nodes
 * (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value,
 * together with a list of references to nodes (the children), with the constraints that
 * no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root
 * <p>
 * A tree is a (possibly non-linear) data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges
 * without having any cycle. The tree with no nodes is called the <b>null</b> or
 * <b>empty</b> tree. A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many
 * levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy
 * <h1>Terminology</h1>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Node</b> - a single point of a tree</li>
 *     <li><b>Edge</b> - line, which connects two distinct nodes</li>
 *     <li><b>Root</b> - top node of the tree, which has no parent</li>
 *     <li><b>Parent</b> - a node, other than the root, which is connected to other successor
 *                         nodes</li>
 *     <li><b>Child</b> - a node, other than the root, which is connected to predecessor</li>
 *     <li><b>Leaf</b> - a node without children</li>
 *     <li><b>Path</b> - a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a
 *                       descendant</li>
 *     <li><b>Path Length</b> - number of nodes in the path - 1</li>
 *     <li><b>Ancestor</b> - the top parent node of the path</li>
 *     <li><b>Descendant</b> - the bottom child node of the path</li>
 *     <li><b>Siblings</b> - nodes, which have the same parent</li>
 *     <li><b>Subtree</b> - a node in a tree with all of its proper descendants, if any</li>
 *     <li><b>Node Height</b> - the number of edges on the longest downward path between that
 *                              node and a leaf</li>
 *     <li><b>Tree Height</b> - the number of edges on the longest downward path between the
 *                              root and a leaf (root height)</li>
 *     <li><b>Depth (Level)</b> - the path length between the root and the current node</li>
 *     <li><b>Ordered Tree</b> - tree in which nodes has the children ordered</li>
 *     <li><b>Labeled Tree</b> - tree in which a label or value is associated with each node
 *                               of the tree</li>
 *     <li><b>Expression Tree</b> - tree which specifies the association of an expressionï¿½s
 *                                  operands and its operators in a uniform way, regardless
 *                                  of whether the association is required by the placement
 *                                  of parentheses in the expression or by the precedence and
 *                                  associativity rules for the operators involved</li>
 *     <li><b>Branching Factor</b> - maximum number of children a node can have</li>
 *     <li><b>Pre order</b> - a form of tree traversal, where the action is called firstly on
 *                           the current node, and then the pre order function is called again
 *                           recursively on each of the subtree from left to right</li>
 *     <li><b>Post order</b> - a form of tree traversal, where the post order function is called
 *                            recursively on each subtree from left to right and then the
 *                            action is called</li>
 * </ul>
